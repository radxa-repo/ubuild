# ubuild - Radxa U-Boot Build Tool

**DEPRECATED**

`ubuild` is deprecated without even getting a release:open_mouth:. Don't worry, its features are now merged with `lbuild` to form a new tool called [`bsp`](https://github.com/radxa-repo/bsp) to reduce code duplication, and to speed up building for multiple boards from a single source tree, like what `lbuild` was doing.
